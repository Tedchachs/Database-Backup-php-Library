# Database-Backup-php-Library
It's a backup library file to help developers who interact with the database to have an alternative while creating the backup files using other libraries.

To effectively utilize the library, follow these steps:

Begin by creating your desired controller file in your PHP application. Load the library by including the necessary dependencies and instantiating the Backup class from the CodeIgniter\Database namespace. 

For example:

use CodeIgniter\Database\Backup(This is a dammy file name you can give it your prefered name ;
// Load the necessary dependencies and instantiate the Backup class
$backup = new Backup($db);

Ensure that the library file is added or created within the ThirdParty directory of your project. To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder within the ThirdParty directory and assign it a relevant name.
2. Inside this newly created folder, create a new file.
3. Paste the code provided in the library file into this newly created file.

Once the library file is in place, you can use it within your controller file. Make sure to import the necessary namespaces at the beginning of your controller file.
The library will quickly create a backup of the database by calling the backup function. All of the database's tables, rows, and columns will be included in the backup file that is created and may be found at the supplied path and filename.

By following these instructions, you can efficiently use the library to streamline the creation of a thorough database backup with little effort.
